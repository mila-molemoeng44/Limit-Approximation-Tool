# Limit-Approximation-Tool
This is a simplified limit approximation tool that shows the left and right hand side behaviour of a continuous parabola. This code is inspired by elementary concepts of Calculus. 

The user input is described as a limit, but should be thought of an index for an x value -10 and 10. There are 1000 unique numberic values(ranging from 0 to 999) of x that can be given as input and correspond to a unique x value. 

The program works by the user providing a limit index and the program then visually showing the left and right hand behaviour of the limit through a loop. The program then provides the limit behaviour from both sides.
